SEO should be invisible to readers\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use HTML tags, NOT Markdown syntax. WordPress needs HTML to display proper formatting and styling.\n\n## CRITICAL REMINDERS\n\n- Write like a human expert, not an AI\n- No corporate buzzword soup\n- Get to the point fast\n- Every sentence must earn its place\n- If you wouldn't say it in real life, don't write it\n- Focus on helping the reader, not impressing them with vocabulary\n\nRemember: Good SEO content ranks because it's genuinely useful, not because it hits a checklist. Write something people actually want to read.\n\nBegin writing the article now.",
